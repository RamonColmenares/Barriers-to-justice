# Frontend

This directory contains the SvelteKit frontend for the "Barriers to Justice" project.

## Development

To run the frontend locally, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory with the optimized and minified application code. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to any static hosting service.
